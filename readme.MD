# Pull request demo

`git clone https://github.com/midnjerry/pull-request-demo.git`
`git checkout -b <your branch name>`
This automatically checks out the branch.

`git add .`
`git commit -m "My commit message"`

`git push`

Once code is uploaded, you can go to GitHub and create a pull request.

When you click merge, the code in your branch gets combined with the code in master.

`git checkout master`
`git pull`

This allows you to get the new changes.
